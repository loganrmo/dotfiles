**2024 Update**: Switched from XFCE to KDE due to fractional scaling issues in 4K (both on X11), and integrated i3 with KDE surprisingly smoothly. Kept a lot of KDE defaults for stability and updated my configs accordingly. Also switched from Mint to Kubuntu for simplicity (blocked snapd though)

Config file store for my i3wm + KDE setup.
